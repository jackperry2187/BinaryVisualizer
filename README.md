## Setup  
Clone the repository, then double click the `run` file. 
This file start everything for you, meaning it will:  
-Run `npm i`  
-Open your default broswer to http://localhost:3000  
-Run `npm start`  

From there, simply enter the desired amount of bits or bytes you're working with, reading direction of your binary (right -> left means the highest value number is to the left), and enter any binary or decimal numbers. Alternatively, you can also select a maximum decimal value from the bottom, which will set the bits and bytes for you, and you can then enter any binary or decimal numbers.

## Skills Used
